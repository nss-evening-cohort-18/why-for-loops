# Why for loops?

This repo is to demonstrate the various types of for loops you can use to 
iterate through the items in a collection. to go to a specific example, you
can checkout a tag using the command `git checkout {nameOfTag}`. to see a list
of all tags, simply run `git tag` in your terminal. As of this writing, the
current tags are: 
```
basic-for-loop
for-loop-iterator
for-of-example
foreach
